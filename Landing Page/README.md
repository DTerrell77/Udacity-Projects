Landing Page Project!

This landing page is suppose to be a representation of a fan page for both the Marvel and DC Universe!
I wanted this project to show unique ideas of how to build an interactive website for users 
to enjoy and learn more about the superheros that they love! Instead of a single page, I made a split page
that has a Marvel section and then a DC section. The user can hover over either section and that section
will expand while the other section shrinks and becomes darker for the other section to pop out more. 

Below are some screenshots of what the pages look like!
