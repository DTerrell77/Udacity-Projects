        <h2>This summer I built my first computer! I went to the Micro Center
            with my girlfriend and my father to purchase a gaming computer. I went in knowing what I wanted and needed 
            from the hours of youtube videos that I watched in order to build the computer when I bought it. I have
            two friends who also have gaming computers and I always wanted to have
            and build one of my own. Gaming computers do not come with a cheap price tag,
            it all depends on the components and how well you want to run a game of your choice
            but if you want to play a game at quality settings then it will be a hefty chunk of change.
            The gaming setup that I went with came out to be around $1500 including the monitor and keyboard.
            When I got home from the store, I started to build my computer but it was no easy task. It took me many
            hours to build and a couple more to figure out why it wouldn't turn on. Make sure to use this as a life lesson
            when it comes to building computers, always read the manual and plug everything in!

        <h2>
            The tips that I am going to be listing are things that I found helpful in my experience for building gaming computers:
            <ul>
                <li>Watch Youtube Videos of previous gaming builds</li>
                <li>Make a list of components that you want in your build</li>
                <li>Optional: Look on various websites for sales on specific components</li>
                <li>Make sure the motherboard and ghthe CPU work together (should say which cpu works on the motherboardss box)</li>
                <li> If you don't understand something you have two options:</li>
                    <h2>1.) Refer to the components manual</h2>
                    <h2>2.)Watch a video on that component</h2>
            </ul>
        </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="cpu"><u><b>CPU</b></u>
        <h2>I chose the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-core processor for my computer. It was the best price ($189) for what I wanted my computer to handle.
            This is one of the most important and fragile components of the computer. If you bend the pins on the back while installing it into the motherboard
            then the whole computer will not work. This was also the most nerve-wracking thing I have ever done. 
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/amd.jpg">
    </div> 
    <div class="box" id="mobo"><u><b>Motherboard</b></u>
        <h2>The motherboard is probably the next important piece in the computer because both the CPU and the motherboard have to be compatible. 
            I went with a fairly basic motherboard and I don't think it was too expensive ($125).
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/asus.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="ram"><u><b>RAM</b></u>
        <h2>The RAM is really important because its your computers way of storing memory in a place that can be accessed very fast. For my computer
            I chose 2x8GB RAM sticks so that my computer can be as fast as possible. Now you can get fancy RAM where it has LED lights on it so that it
            can look cool in your case but I just went with two regualar ones becasuse it was the cheaper option. 
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/ram.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="storage"><u><b>Storage</b></u>
        <h2>Since you want know about gaming computers then listen closely. Storage is essential for a gaming computer because if you want to plau titles like
            call of duty which require 100GB and many gb updates afterthat, then you need to invest in at least a 500GB ssd drive or hard drive. The best way is to
            purchase an ssd drive to be used for the installation of your operating system and a hard drive for all of your games. I didn't do this when I bought my m.2 ssd drive
            for my storage because it was the cheaper option and it saved me room in my build since I could put the m.2 ssd drive directly onto my motherboard. 
        </h2>

    <div class="box" id="gpu"><u><b>GPU</b></u>
        <h2>Now the moment every gamer has been waiting for. The GPU is just like the CPU except it renders everything on your computer screen. I went with an NVIDIA GTX 2060 
            graphics card and I couldn't have been happier. I can run almost any game above 100 fps on max settings. Of course this meant that I spent more money on this specific part
            because I wanted to have a nice expierence while gaming. The price of this graphics card was around $400.
        </h2>

    </div>
    <div class="box" id="power"><u><b>Power Supply</b></u>
        <h2>The Power Supply is essential for any computer because it needs to power all of those components. For a gaming computer, you should always go for at least a 500 watt 
            power supply. I went with an 800 watt power supply because thats all the store had at the time. Another tip for a power supply is to make sure it has the label 80 gold or higher.
            This was around $150. 
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/power.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="case"><u><b>Case</b></u>
        <h2>I wanted a pretty cool case so I chose one that was still under a $100. Make sure to buy one that is big enough to fit all of these components.
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/case.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="monitor"><u><b>Monitor</b></u>
        <h2>The monitor is the next imortant piece outside of the gaming rig itself. I went with a 1080p 27'' 165hz monitor for around $250. Monitors can be very expensive but I found one
            that was in my budget. If you want to use your computer to play games then you will have to choose a monitor that has at least 1080p and 120hz refresh rate to play games that you
            want. 
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/monitor.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="fans"><u><b>Lights/Fans</b></u>
        <h2>Lights are not necessairly needed for a computer but it sure does look nice when you get it all setup inside your gaming computer. Now, for fans you will need some in order to cool
            down your computer when you are playing games or anything else that is demanding. Usually, the CPU comes with a fan specifically for the CPU but if not just purchase an extra one
            for it. I have at least 4 fans in my computer and I think that is enough to keep your computer cool. 
        </h2>
        <img id="components" src="images/fan.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="keyboard"><u><b>Keyboard & Mouse</b></u>
        <h2>This next part is optional. You don't need to have a light up keyboard and mouse but in this case that is what I did. It just really adds to the feel and mood while you're playing 
            video games. It a cool gimmick but if you are going for a cheap budget then I would recommend getting a keyboard and mouse with it lighting up.
